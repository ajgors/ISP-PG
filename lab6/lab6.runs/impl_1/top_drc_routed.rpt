2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell processor/data_path_loop[4].second_operand.out_port_lut is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A5*A2)+(A5*(~A2)*(~A6))+((~A5)*A2*A6)'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>
